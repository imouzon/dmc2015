#Welcome to our github page

##What do I do now

Congratulations - you have taken the first step in this competition.
Unless something goes wrong, we are going to be using Github as our main source of activity.
git is a powerful tool for collaborating - people can get your changes instantly and multiple people can even work on the same file.
If changes are made accidentally (or poorly) they can be reverted back to what they were.
While it may take some adjusting, using git is easy to pick up and you can get comfortable with it pretty quickly.

Since you can see this page it means that you have been added as a collaborater to the ISU DMC 2015 github repo.
All the files in the box above this one are now available to you. All you have to do is get git.

###OSX/Linux
There is no need to install anything on these systems. They both know the git command by default.
Since our repository is being hosted by the website Github, you may find it simpler to use the 
[Github application](https://mac.github.com/) to keep your work up-to-date with the team.
While I try to do most of my work from the command line, I still frequently use the app.

#### Cloning the repo
This is how you get the files from the repo to your computer.
It is as simple as using the command line to navigate to the directory where you want to put the DMC folder and 
typing the following:
`git clone https://github.imouzon.com/dmc2015/`
