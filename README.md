This is going to be an adventure!

From the [prudsys task description](http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/wettbewerb/aufgabe.html):

> ###Scenario
> This year’s DATA MINING CUP competition (DMC for short) deals with the topic of coupon generation.
> What is interesting in this case is the impact of coupons on the shopping basket value as well as the redemption rate of the individual coupons.
> Coupons have been used as purchase incentives for some time now, not only by mail order companies.
> This presents interesting challenges, including the question: “Who responds to coupons?”, and then the question: “Who would have made the purchase even without the coupon?”.
> Only by giving equal consideration to both of these questions can we arrive at profitable couponing.
> Data mining processes, in particular scoring processes, can be used to answer these questions.
> Such processes make it possible to create forecasting models which provide answers to both questions.

> ###About the task
> Using the historical order data from an online shop with accompanying coupon generation,
> a model should be created that comes up with a prediction for the redeemed coupons and for the shopping basket value for new orders within the shop.
> The historical data contains both a time stamp of the coupon generation and the orders as well as different product and customer attributes.
> The information “coupon redeemed yes/no” and the basket value of the order are also known for the historical data.

First observation - this data set is not large...
