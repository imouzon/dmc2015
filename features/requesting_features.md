#Request a Feature
Have an idea for a feature, but not sure how to construct it?
You're in luck - to request a feature simply create an "issue" describing the feature you would like to create.
Someone, somewhere, maybe, will be able to either get you on the right path or create it themselves.
Once the issue is created, they can close the issue.
