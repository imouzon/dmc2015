Meet The ISU 2015 Data Mining Cup Team
======================================
<!--
This is the team picture page. 
I know that I am bad with names and faces, and I imagine some of you are too. 
The idea here is that making this page will be a fun exercise to get used to editing documents on github
and to help us get to know each other.

So - the idea is this:

Add a picture to the team_pics folder, and edit the following template:
-->

<img src="./team_pics/ian.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">
