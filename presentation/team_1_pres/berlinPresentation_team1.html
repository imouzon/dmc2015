-  The largest city, Des Moines, only has a population of about 600,000
-  The largest producer of corn, ethanol, and soybeans in the United States
-  There are more pigs than people in Iowa
-  It is named after the Iowa river which itself is named after the Native American "Ioway" tribe.
-  It is the birth place of the actor John Wayne (The Searchers, Red River, ...)

  ### Find Structure
]

##The Data Didn't Just Appear Randomly

-  There must be some **structure** underlying it 
-  There must be some **unit** generating it in the context of the structure

**Here's an analogy**:

-  The tracks the structure
-  The train is the unit, whose future position is uncertain but constrained by the tracks

   <h2>Coupons Expire</h2>

</center>
- Batches of coupons are sent every Monday at 11:59 p.m.
- They keep the same coupons for one week
- After that week has passed, they can not use the coupons anymore and instead have three new coupons.

## The Structure Matters

- We can examine how the customers (the units) behave in this structure of coupon delivery and expiration

<center>
   <img src="www/figs/order_fast-shop_fast.png" alt="orderFast" height=320></img>
</center>

- This structure is important - customers who receive coupons early and shop quickly are more likely to use them.

   #Nothing Else We Did Worked
</center>

##We had nothing working for us at all

- Attempts to uncover the base value of the coupons:  **failed**
- Attempts to fit a statistical model to user behavior: **failed**
- Attempts to exploit data "oddities": **failed**

##There was just no clever way to unlock the data

   <h1> We needed good general methods </h1>
   <img src="www/figs/knifetool.jpg" alt="dmc logo" height="150"> 
</center>

- Give up trying to find clever features use best tools to chip away
- Use structure and meaning to find aspects of the data structure

- **LLR**: likelihood a coupon is used examined through different filters 
- **tf-idf**: measure similarity of a trio of coupons 

<center>
   <h2> Lots of Features Means Lots of Rules</h2>
</center>

- Historical data sets used to provide background data 

- Train on one set, validate all methods on common set

## The new challenge is balancing this enormous set in a way that we still get reliable predictions
## Reduce features by selection 
Once we had applied these general methods we had another problem: almost 1000 columns in feature matrix.

- Hundreds of features based on LLRs and tf-idf

- Most features are only weakly related to response

- Needed an easy way to select strongest features.

# Reducing the Features

## Some ML Methods Can Identify Important Features
Many machine techniques have importance criteria to help identify usefule features.
Iteratively run on subsets of data, these can help us reduce the size of our feature matrix:

- Random forest found 305 important features

- C5.0 found 83

- adaboost found 105

- Lasso (**l**east **a**bsolute **s**hrinkage and **s**election **o**perator) chose 78

These featues made up our final feature matrix

#Putting Predictor Together
Combining predictors leads to the best final prediction

## The best solution involved a 45/55 part combination of 

1. Predictions fit by lasso based on variables selected by Gradiant Boosting Machines
2. Predictions fit by Gradient Boosting Methods based on variables selected by C5.0
