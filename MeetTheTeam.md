Meet The ISU 2015 Data Mining Cup Team
======================================
<!--
This is the team picture page. 
I know that I am bad with names and faces, and I imagine some of you are too. 
The idea here is that making this page will be a fun exercise to get used to editing documents on github
and to help us get to know each other.

So - the idea is this:

Add a picture to the team_pics folder, and edit the following template:

<a href="./" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"  src="YOUR IMAGE URL" width="100"/></a><br/><br/>
<div style="background-color: #FFF8C6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px;">
<b>This is a colored box</b><br/>
This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go. This is where your text will go.
</div>

The parts you need to edit are <LIKE THIS> (take out the < and > parts too)
