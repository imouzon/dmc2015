==============

Our first meeting went really well, but also really quickly.
The slides I presented are in the folder [presentation/introduction](https://github.com/imouzon/dmc2015/blob/master/presentation/introduction/DMC2015_intro.pdf)

##I Forgot SO Many Things
Our DMC meetings are usually "working meetings," 
by which I mean everyone works on things and we talk about 
plans/issues regarding the data and our approach to it.
There will never be that much talking by me again.
These are the things I forgot to do:

- Introduce myself in a proper way
- Let everyone else introduce themselves
- Pass around the "how comfortable are you with R/python/matlab/etc" sheet
- Give everyone time to edit MeetTheTeam.md
- Schedule future meetings
- Take everyone on a tour of the github page

Yikes! 
That's a lot of stuff to forget. 
We'll fix the first 3 next meeting, and I will fix the last 2 now. 
I can see that people are adding things to MeetTheTeam.md as I write this, 
so I suppose that is fixing itself.

###The repository landing page
This is the first page you see on [https://github.com/imouzon/dmc2015/](https://github.com/imouzon/dmc2015/).
If you are just starting to use git, then these are the things you want to know:

You can see the repository file structure and view files just by visiting the github page:
